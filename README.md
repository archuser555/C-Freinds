# C Freinds
**C Freinds is a basic platformer game written in C and OpenGL.**

# How to compile on Linux
**To compile C Freinds on Linux, you will need to have the OpenGL and GLUT libraries installed. You can install these libraries using your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can use the following command:**

``sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglut-dev``
**Once you have the necessary libraries installed, you can compile the game using the GCC compiler. Navigate to the directory where the game source code is located, and use the following command:**

``gcc main.c -o cfreinds -lGL -lGLU -lglut``
**This will compile the game and create an executable file called cfreinds. You can then run the game by typing ./cfreinds in the terminal.**
